# Qt-CodeOptimization-Task-1

Today a client contacted our company Umpun-Numpum and asked to improve his code, because his code is too slow. The client says that this code is processing a very large number of photos, but recently, the audience of his service has grown by 1 person, after which the server can no longer cope with processing 2 people at the same time.

The tasks of the code include:
1. Get all images from **image cache folder**.
2. Sort in QList by last modified time.
3. Perform image operations.
